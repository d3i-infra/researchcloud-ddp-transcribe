# DDP Transcribe — catalog item record & registration runbook

This doc is two things: the **registration runbook** (concrete values for the
portal wizard — Phase 4 of the deployment plan) and the **item record** (filled
in once the item is live). General portal mechanics live in the SURF-distilled
`surf_research_cloud/runbooks/create-catalog-item.md`; this page only carries
the ddp-transcribe-specific values and the decisions you must make at the portal.

## Decisions to make before you start the wizard

These are portal facts I can't see; settle them first.

- [ ] **Owner CO** — *permanent, cannot be changed later.* The existing
  "Next for data donation" item is owned by **D3I data donation**; using the same
  CO is the obvious default unless you want this item maintained separately.
- [ ] **Exact flavour names** — confirm the SURF HPC Cloud GPU flavour names and,
  critically, that a **2×A10** flavour exists (the two-instance design needs two
  physical GPUs in one workspace). If SURF only offers 1×A10, the 2-GPU path is
  blocked and we ship CPU + 1×A10 only.
- [ ] **Developer rights** in the owner CO (`src_co_developer` SRAM group) — without
  these the **Development** tab won't appear.

## Step A — Register the component (Development → Components → +)

The component is created **before** the catalog item (a non-SURF component can't
be added to an item until it exists). The "Add component" wizard has 5 steps.

**Step 1 — script source:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Component script type | Ansible Playbook |
| Source Url repository | `https://github.com/d3i-infra/researchcloud-ddp-transcribe.git` |
| Path | `deploy-ddp-transcribe.yaml` |
| Tag | `main` — *version of the **component repo** SRC clones; distinct from the `pipeline_git_ref` parameter, which pins the **pipeline repo** the playbook builds* |
| Access format / label | leave blank (no web UI — SSH only) |
| Script availability | "publicly available on Git" if the component repo is public; else fixed / CO-secret credentials |

**Step 2 — name, subtitle, description** (developer-facing; the catalog item has
its own user-facing set in Step C):

- **Name:** `ddp-transcribe`
- **Subtitle:** Provisions a video-transcription pipeline workspace (CUDA, Rust, yt-dlp, whisper models)
- **Description:** Ansible playbook that bakes a `ddp-transcribe` workspace.
  **Base OS: Ubuntu 24.04** (the `libclang-18-dev` pin is 24.04-specific). Builds
  the pipeline from a pinned git ref with whisper-rs (`--features cuda` on GPU
  flavours), installs `yt-dlp[curl-cffi]` and the selected whisper models, lays
  out inbox/transcripts/archive on the attached volume and the state DB on the
  boot disk. CUDA toolkit 13.2 is detect-else-install; never installs drivers.
  Operator-driven, SSH only.
- **Icon:** `assets/icon.png` (d3i brand palette; <100KB, reads at 32–40px)

**Step 3 — parameters:** **DO NOT SKIP.** SRC does *not* auto-discover variables
from the playbook — you must declare each parameter here by hand, or it will not
appear at the catalog item's Parameters step (a param "not explicitly required by
a component has no effect"). Declare exactly these (defaults match the playbook's
`vars:`; the two without a default are required):

Each declaration has a **Source type** (`Fixed` / `Resource` / `Co-Secret` /
`Workspace`) and an **Overwritable** checkbox. For all ten of ours: Source type
= **`Fixed`** (a literal value you type) and **Overwritable = checked** — the
Overwritable flag is what lets the catalog item later "Make interactive" or
"Overwrite"; unchecked locks the value at the component default.

| Parameter | Source type | Default value | Overwritable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `storage_path` | Fixed | *(leave blank — required at launch)* | ✓ |
| `pipeline_user` | Fixed | *(leave blank — required at launch)* | ✓ |
| `model_large_v3_turbo` | Fixed | `true` | ✓ |
| `model_tiny_en` | Fixed | `false` | ✓ |
| `model_small` | Fixed | `false` | ✓ |
| `pipeline_git_ref` | Fixed | `v0.2.0-rc1` | ✓ |
| `download_workers` | Fixed | `3` | ✓ |
| `compute_lang_probs` | Fixed | `false` | ✓ |
| `run_smoke_test` | Fixed | `false` | ✓ |
| `force_cpu_build` | Fixed | `false` | ✓ |

`storage_path`/`pipeline_user` "required-ness" is enforced by making them
interactive at the catalog item **and** the playbook's preflight `assert`
backstop. The model flags' `true`/`false` values render as checkboxes once made
interactive (the playbook coerces with `| bool`). Other source types are unused:
`Co-Secret` (we have no secrets), `Resource`, `Workspace` (could in principle
inject `pipeline_user` from the workspace user — not relied on; matches the d3i
"Next" item's interactive-username pattern). Do *not* declare
`co_passwordless_sudo` / `timeout` /
`remote_ansible_version` here — those belong to SRC-CO and SRC-External plugin
and surface at the catalog item Parameters step on their own. Internals
(`pipeline_git_repo`, `cuda_*`) stay as playbook vars, undeclared. No Component
Secrets — the pipeline repo and all downloads (NVIDIA, HuggingFace, crates.io)
are public/anonymous.

> If you already created the component without parameters: **edit** it (don't
> recreate). Editing overwrites the development version; the catalog item, which
> references that development version, will then show the parameters.

**Step 4 — owner & support:** owner CO (see decisions above), support url/name/email.

**Step 5 — organizations:** **restrict to the owner CO** — component visibility
*cannot be withdrawn*, so do not make it public.

> **Two version pins, don't confuse them:** the Step 1 **Tag** pins the component
> repo (`main`); the `pipeline_git_ref` parameter pins the pipeline repo
> (`v0.2.0-rc1`). A provisioning-only fix changes the component (re-clone `main`,
> re-run); a pipeline release changes `pipeline_git_ref` (rebuild).

## Step B — Catalog item wizard, Step 1: Components (order matters)

```
1. SRC-OS
2. SRC-CO
3. SRC-External plugin  (the plain Ansible runner — NOT "Docker", "Docker
   Compose", or "pluginansible2.11"; keep its remote_ansible_version at 9.1.0)
4. ddp-transcribe        ← must come after SRC-External
```

**No SRC-Nginx** — the pipeline has no web UI; access is SSH only.

## Step C — Name & description

User-facing (the Catalog tab); keep distinct from the component's Step 2 set.

- **Name:** DDP Transcribe
- **Subtitle:** Video transcription pipeline for data-donation studies
- **Description:** A ready-to-run workspace that transcribes donor-watched
  videos from TikTok DDP exports. Whisper.cpp transcription (GPU-accelerated on
  NVIDIA flavours); select your models at launch and point it at an attached
  storage volume. SSH in and drive it with the generated run scripts
  (`init` / `ingest` / `process`).
- **Icon:** `assets/icon.png` (same as the component)

## Step D — Owner & support

- **Owner CO:** _(your decision above — PERMANENT)_
- **Documentation URL:** `https://github.com/d3i-infra/researchcloud-ddp-transcribe`
- **Support name / email:** _(maintainer)_

## Step E — Access

- **Allowed collaborations:** explicit whitelist (the owner CO; add others only
  as needed). Do **not** use "on request" unless you want catalog-wide visibility.

## Step F — Cloud settings

- **Provider:** SURF HPC Cloud
- **OS:** Ubuntu **24.04** (the `libclang-18-dev` pin is 24.04-specific — do not
  offer 22.04)
- **Flavours** (offer the subset you want selectable):
  - one CPU flavour with high core count (faster cargo build) — e.g. 16 Core - 64 GB
  - **1×A10** GPU flavour
  - **2×A10** GPU flavour (if available — see decisions above)

## Step G — Parameters (Step 6)

Wiring per the component README. Action column: Keep / Overwrite / Make-interactive.

| Parameter | Source | Action | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `storage_path` | ddp-transcribe | **Make interactive** | creator supplies the mounted volume path, e.g. `/home/<user>/data/<volume>` |
| `pipeline_user` | ddp-transcribe | **Make interactive** | the workspace user (their SRC username) |
| `model_large_v3_turbo` | ddp-transcribe | **Make interactive** | checkbox; default true |
| `model_tiny_en` | ddp-transcribe | **Make interactive** | checkbox; default false |
| `model_small` | ddp-transcribe | **Make interactive** | checkbox; default false |
| `pipeline_git_ref` | ddp-transcribe | Keep | `v0.2.0-rc1` until promoted to `v0.2.0` |
| `download_workers` | ddp-transcribe | Keep | `3` |
| `compute_lang_probs` | ddp-transcribe | Keep | `false` |
| `run_smoke_test` | ddp-transcribe | Keep | `false` (operator smokes by hand post-provision) |
| `force_cpu_build` | ddp-transcribe | Keep | `false` |
| `co_passwordless_sudo` | SRC-CO | **Overwrite** | `true` |
| `timeout` | SRC-External | **Overwrite** | `7200` — see note below |
| `remote_ansible_version` | SRC-External | Keep | `9.1.0` |

> **timeout:** the default 3600 s may be too tight for a *cold* provision — the
> `cargo build --release --features cuda` of whisper-rs compiles CUDA kernels via
> nvcc (the long pole), on top of the ~5 GB toolkit install and the ~573 MB model
> download. Set 7200 for the first validation and tune down once the cold
> wallclock is measured (record it below).

## Step H — Workspace settings

- **Access button:** Command line (SSH)
- **Firewall:** inbound TCP **22** only; all outbound open (GitHub, NVIDIA repo,
  HuggingFace, crates.io, TikTok CDNs). Leave "allow owner to change security
  groups" unchecked to lock the firewall.

| From | To | IP | Direction | Protocol | Mutable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | 22 | 0.0.0.0/0 | in | tcp | No |

## Tier 5 — validation pass (after Submit)

1. Launch a workspace on **1×A10** with an attached storage volume; supply
   `storage_path` + `pipeline_user`; check the model boxes you want.
2. Watch the deployment log to green — **no manual SSH fixes allowed** (that's
   the whole point of the catalog item).
3. SSH in and verify: `ddp-transcribe --help`; `ldd $(which ddp-transcribe) | grep
   libcudart`; `ls <storage>/models/`; `ls ~/run-pipeline-gpu0.sh ~/ddp-state/`.
4. Operator smoke: drop a fixture DDP JSON into `<storage>/inbox`,
   `~/run-pipeline-gpu0.sh init`, `… ingest`, `… process --max-videos 3`,
   inspect a transcript artifact with `jq`.
5. Relaunch on **2×A10**: confirm both `~/run-pipeline-gpu0.sh` and
   `-gpu1.sh` exist; run both concurrently; `nvidia-smi` shows load on both GPUs.
   **First real test of two-process claim contention (R11)** — watch for stale
   `processing` rows / double-claims in the shared state DB.
6. Pause/resume the workspace; confirm the run layout survives.
7. Promote component **development → pilot → live**; once live, tag the pipeline
   repo **`v0.2.0`** and bump `pipeline_git_ref` to it (overwrite stays in the item).
